# Financial-Risk-Predction
Financial Risk Prediction Project

Project Overview

The Financial Risk Prediction project leverages machine learning algorithms and data analytics to assess and predict potential financial risks. This project aims to provide insights into the likelihood of financial defaults, fraud detection, and overall risk management by analyzing historical financial data.

Objectives

Develop a predictive model to identify high-risk financial transactions.

Analyze large datasets to detect patterns and anomalies indicative of financial risk.

Provide actionable insights to improve decision-making and mitigate financial losses.

Key Features

Data Ingestion: Collect and preprocess financial datasets from various sources.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze data to uncover patterns.

Feature Engineering: Develop meaningful features to improve model performance.

Model Development: Train machine learning models to predict financial risks.

Model Evaluation: Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

Deployment: Deploy the predictive model for real-time risk assessment.

Technologies and Tools

Programming Language: Python, R

Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Deployment: Flask, FastAPI, Docker

Cloud Platforms: AWS, IBM Watson Studio

Data Sources

Financial transaction datasets (e.g., credit card transactions, loan applications).

Publicly available financial data.

Proprietary company data.
